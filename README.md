# First Jump!

My first project to learn about creating simple games using pygame-ce.

### My Goal -

The goal with this project was to use my knowledge gained from learning Python and use it to develop something that interests me, Gaming! I found Pygame, a module that enables you to create games, Perfect. So I thought of a basic concept that would be achievable, that I could complete and be proud of! 

From some research I found that Pygame is quite good for 2D platformer games, and I could recreate a simple version of Geometry Dash. After a few days, a lot of trial and error, reading the Pygame docs and tutorials of the features I wanted to implement. I had something that was functional, basic, but it worked! Over a couple of weeks of adding new things, breaking things, fixing them and breaking them again. I had what you see here. A functional game with menu states, animated sprites, collisions, sounds, a score counter and a basic jumping mechanic. It's not perfect, but it works! 

## How To Play -

### Dependencies:

First Jump requires [Pygame (Community Edition)](https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/) to run. 

```
pip install pygame-ce
```

### Objective:

Survive as long as you can by avoiding incoming enemies! Jump over slimes, run under birds. If you get hit by an enemy, the game is over!

### Controls:

```
SPACE: Jump / Start New Game

Q: Quit
```
