# First Jump!

### My Goal -

The goal of this project was to apply what I have learnt within Python to develop something that interests me, gaming! I found Pygame, a module that enables you to create games, Perfect. So I thought of a relatively simple concept that would be viable, that I could complete and be proud of! 

After some research, I found that Pygame is well-suited for 2D platformer games, and I was able to recreate a simple version of Geometry Dash. After a few days, a lot of trial and error, reading the [Pygame docs](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) and a few YouTube tutorials on the features I wanted to implement. I had something functional, basic, but it worked! Over a couple of weeks of adding new things, breaking things, fixing them and breaking them again. I had what you see here. A functional game with menu states, animated sprites, collisions, sounds, a score counter and a basic jumping mechanic. It's not perfect, but it works!
